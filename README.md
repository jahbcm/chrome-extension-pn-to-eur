PLN-to-EUR 

this is a chrome extension, uncompressed, that:
- When a price in polish złoty is detected, adds the euro corresponding one between parenthesis next to it.
- Adds a pop up window in the extension menu, where fast conversions between złoty  and euros can be performed.

The price conversion is fetched dynamically, making the extension maintenance free.

This software was created as a fun and useful project for my own personal needs, and provided as it is.
